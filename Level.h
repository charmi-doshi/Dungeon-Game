//  A single dungeon floor. This is the Level extraction we planned at the
//  Interlude: the map, the monsters and the items now belong to a FLOOR, not
//  to the game globally. The Game owns a stack of these and swaps between them
//  as the player descends. Each Level keeps its own explored/visible state (in
//  its map), so a floor you return to looks exactly as you left it.
